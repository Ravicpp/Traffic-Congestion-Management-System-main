# Traffic-Congestion-Management-System-main
The Traffic Congestion Management System is a project designed to optimize traffic flow during peak hours.
It leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques, particularly the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture, to dynamically manage traffic lights.
The system detects the number of vehicles in each lane in real time and adjusts the traffic light timings accordingly to minimize congestion. 
This approach ensures efficient lane management and reduces traffic bottlenecks.
